# Key Features of This Repository:
    - Basic DFS Implementation: A clear implementation of DFS for both graphs and trees, showcasing recursive and iterative approaches.
    - Applications of DFS:
    - Path Finding: Finding paths in mazes or puzzles.
    - Cycle Detection: Identifying cycles in directed and undirected graphs.
    - Topological Sorting: Performing topological ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
    - Connected Components: Identifying connected components in an undirected graph.
    - Backtracking: Solving problems like the N-Queens problem and generating permutations.
    - Visual Representation: Graphical illustrations of DFS traversal to aid understanding.
    - Complexity Analysis: Analysis of time and space complexity for DFS in different scenarios.
# C++ Implementation Highlights:
    - Use of STL (Standard Template Library): Utilizes vectors, stacks, and maps to efficiently represent graphs and manage data during traversal.
    - Recursive and Iterative Approaches: Provides both recursive and stack-based implementations of DFS to demonstrate different methodologies.
    - Code Documentation: Each implementation is well-commented to enhance understanding and provide insights into the algorithm's workings.
    - This repository serves as an excellent resource for anyone looking to deepen their understanding of the Depth-First Search algorithm, its applications, and its implementations in C++.
